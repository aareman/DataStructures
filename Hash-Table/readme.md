# Hash Table

## The design

This Hash table class uses a universal hashing function as well as the method of open addressing to address collisions. As of now the hashtable on deals with strings which is good for dictionary lookups.

## Asymtotics
As to be expected with an open addressing hashtable that uses a universal hashing function for a table of size 2n the average access time is O(1).
